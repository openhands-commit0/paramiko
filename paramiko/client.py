    A high-level representation of a session with an SSH server.  This class

        Connect to an SSH server and authenticate to it.  The server's host key
        is checked against the system host keys (see `load_system_host_keys`)
        and any local host keys (`load_host_keys`).  If the server's hostname

              - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths

                ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
                key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
                itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
                this to occur - *just* the certificate.)

            - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
            - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
              ``~/.ssh/``

              - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
                existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
                ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
                the private key and used for authentication.

            - Plain username/password auth, if a password was given

        If a private key requires a password to unlock it, and a password is
        passed in, that password will be used to attempt to unlock the key.
