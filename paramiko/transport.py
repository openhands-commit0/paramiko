        Create a new SSH session over an existing socket, or socket-like
        object.  This only creates the `.Transport` object; it doesn't begin
        the SSH session yet.  Use `connect` or `start_client` to begin a client
        session, or `start_server` to begin a server session.

        If the object is not actually a socket, it must have the following
        methods:

        - ``send(bytes)``: Writes from 1 to ``len(bytes)`` bytes, and returns
          an int representing the number of bytes written.  Returns
          0 or raises ``EOFError`` if the stream has been closed.
        - ``recv(int)``: Reads from 1 to ``int`` bytes and returns them as a
          string.  Returns 0 or raises ``EOFError`` if the stream has been
          closed.
        - ``close()``: Closes the socket.
        - ``settimeout(n)``: Sets a (float) timeout on I/O operations.

        For ease of use, you may also pass in an address (as a tuple) or a host
        string as the ``sock`` argument.  (A host string is a hostname with an
        optional port (separated by ``":"``) which will be converted into a
        tuple of ``(hostname, port)``.)  A socket will be connected to this
        address and used for communication.  Exceptions from the ``socket``
        call may be thrown in this case.

        .. note::
            Modifying the the window and packet sizes might have adverse
            effects on your channels created from this transport. The default
            values are the same as in the OpenSSH code base and have been
            battle tested.

        :param socket sock:
            a socket or socket-like object to create the session over.
        :param int default_window_size:
            sets the default window size on the transport. (defaults to
            2097152)
        :param int default_max_packet_size:
            sets the default max packet size on the transport. (defaults to
            32768)
        :param bool gss_kex:
            Whether to enable GSSAPI key exchange when GSSAPI is in play.
            Default: ``False``.
        :param bool gss_deleg_creds:
            Whether to enable GSSAPI credential delegation when GSSAPI is in
            play. Default: ``True``.
        :param dict disabled_algorithms:
            If given, must be a dictionary mapping algorithm type to an
            iterable of algorithm identifiers, which will be disabled for the
            lifetime of the transport.

            Keys should match the last word in the class' builtin algorithm
            tuple attributes, such as ``"ciphers"`` to disable names within
            ``_preferred_ciphers``; or ``"kex"`` to disable something defined
            inside ``_preferred_kex``. Values should exactly match members of
            the matching attribute.

            For example, if you need to disable
            ``diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`` key exchange (perhaps because
            your code talks to a server which implements it differently from
            Paramiko), specify ``disabled_algorithms={"kex":
            ["diffie-hellman-group16-sha512"]}``.
        :param bool server_sig_algs:
            Whether to send an extra message to compatible clients, in server
            mode, with a list of supported pubkey algorithms. Default:
            ``True``.
        :param bool strict_kex:
            Whether to advertise (and implement, if client also advertises
            support for) a "strict kex" mode for safer handshaking. Default:
            ``True``.
        :param packetizer_class:
            Which class to use for instantiating the internal packet handler.
            Default: ``None`` (i.e.: use `Packetizer` as normal).

            Added the ``default_window_size`` and ``default_max_packet_size``
            arguments.
